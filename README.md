# Problem Solving with C#.
Here are some of the problems that I solved while learning C#. This problems are from various online judges like Timus Online Judge, LightOJ etc.
These sites has various coding challenges that are mostly **algorithmic & mathematical**. I believe __when learning a language it is essentail to solve problems with that language.__


So that's what I did with C#. I tried to solve as many problem as I could. 

What I learned from solving these problems are -
* Understand the problem that I am working first. That sounds simple but that's the major part of problem which often overlooked.
* Must have to have a deadline. If I can't solve within that period of time I might others for helping. This is one great way of learning.
* Being careful with burn out. 
* Think with pen & paper; not with keyboard
* Learned to use Visual Studio effectively to debug my code
